# Income Prediction Model (UCI Adult Dataset)

This project uses the UCI Adult Census dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year. The goal is to explore classification models, perform feature engineering, and evaluate model performance using Python.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Data Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding (label, one-hot)
- Model comparison (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## 📁 Files
- `Income_Prediction.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, visualizations, and insights
- `adult.csv`: Dataset used (UCI Adult Dataset)
