# 🧾 Income Prediction Model (UCI Adult Dataset)

This project uses the UCI Adult Census dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year. The goal is to build classification models, explore feature importance, and evaluate model performance using Python.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Income_Prediction.ipynb` – Full notebook with code, visualizations, and insights
- `adult.csv` – Dataset from the UCI Adult Census
- `correlation_heatmap.png`, `income_distribution.png`, `income_by_gender.png`, `education_vs_income.png`, `age_distribution_by_income.png` – Visuals used in the notebook

---

## 📌 Insights
- Education level and age show a positive correlation with income.
- Males are more likely to earn >$50K in this dataset.
- Higher hours-per-week and capital gains tend to be associated with higher income levels.
